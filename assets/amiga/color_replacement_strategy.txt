It may sound not very colored but each tile layer uses 10 or 11 colors
(because tiles have a varying palette depending on their index, crazy)

ECS dual playfield is 8+7 colors, we need to reduce to 8+8 (inc black), which is barely
possible with a few compromises on some colors.

1: remove/replace unwanted colors for each level to create specific sheet
2: sort & store the 10 different palettes (5/5)
3: generate 8x8 tiles for each level, cache them
4: index them from cache, cache can be shared BG/FG doesn't matter
