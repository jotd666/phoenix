logic:

- osd_break called when playing (1st level) probably assertion failed
- 60Hz? or 50Hz?
- shield inefficient against boss shots??
- Minor: On the attract sequence, with the final boss and 1 alien flying around,
  when alien is destroyed the explosion does not disappear and is left as part of the background, so to speak.
