logic:

- demo ship not moving: player controls it during the demo!!
- 2P mode switch: videoram seems not updated! check address of say
  lives and check value (42C2=7F)
- AGA: crash character update D0=0x22, D2=0x7F
- AGA: scroll not working

colors:

- palette is completely off after one round of demo (title): check current level
- fmode=3 for AGA
- integrate Toni graphics
