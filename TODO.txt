- demo ship not moving
- when restarting, status bar is erased at first (bank switch at 02b9 ?)
- debug copy_bank / 2P mode (around set_proper_stage_palette_041E
  doesn't seem to set banks properly or switch players like it should
  in _04A2

colors:

- create a 16+16 AGA DPF version

sounds:

- extra life beeps
