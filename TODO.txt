logic:

- debug copy_bank (2player)

- handle_player_shot_0930: value of a0/a1 on entering?
- space debris when killed appear but flicker
- vultures don't shoot
- vultures lowering all the time, should go up from time to time: check handle_vultures_y_2600
  when going up, often locked by random +0 values!!
  when forcing all values to nonzero, vultures scroll/wrap up which
  never happens in the real game!
  **probably: average_vulture_y_pos_in_chars_4BD6/vulture_swarm_height_in_chars_4BD7
  not working proper**
  
- boss: completely crashes
- hit by missiles with shield: illegal?? reproduce??
- special explosions (flame split) don't work, score remains on screen
  (birds & vultures)

colors:

- title: reinstate the light pink for the (c) sign instead
  of white
- first vultures level: yellow not shown for small vultures
- create a 16+16 AGA DPF version

original game bugs:

- updating highscore is to be done in real-time not when restarting a game
- applied Don Hodges fix to avoid score corruption when shooting 3 flying birds
