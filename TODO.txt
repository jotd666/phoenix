logic:

- handle_player_shot_0930: value of a0/a1 on entering?
- center digit of awarded vulture score sometimes bogus, seems to
  be able to corrupt main score for a while too
- boss killed: score not centered on screen
- hit by missiles with shield: illegal?? reproduce??
- debug copy_bank (2player)
- 60Hz

colors:

- title: reinstate the light pink for the (c) sign instead: "F4CDCF":"FFFFFF" when 4008=$79
  of white
- create a 16+16 AGA DPF version

original game bugs:

- updating highscore is to be done in real-time not when restarting a game
- applied Don Hodges fix to avoid score corruption when shooting 3 flying birds
