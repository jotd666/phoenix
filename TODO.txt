logic:

- demo ship not moving: player controls it during the demo!!
- debug copy_bank / 2P mode (around set_proper_stage_palette_041E
  doesn't seem to set banks properly or switch players like it should
  in _04A2 +04A3
- AGA: crash character update D0=0x22, D2=0x7F
- AGA: scroll not working

colors:

- palette is completely off after one round of demo (title): check current level
- fmode=3 for AGA
- integrate Toni graphics
