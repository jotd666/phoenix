logic:

- check demo ship moving?
- when restarting, status bar is erased at first (bank switch at 02b9 ?)
- hit by missiles with shield: illegal?? reproduce??
- debug copy_bank (2player) atm 2P disabled
- save/load highscore

colors:

- title: reinstate the light pink for the (c) sign instead: "F4CDCF":"FFFFFF" when 4008=$79
  of white
- create a 16+16 AGA DPF version

sounds:

- extra life beeps
- missing tunes

original game bugs:

- updating highscore is to be done in real-time not when restarting a game (call update_highscore_02f0)
- applied Don Hodges fix to avoid score corruption when shooting 3 flying birds
