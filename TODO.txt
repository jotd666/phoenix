logic:

- game_in_play_43A2 to allow credit / start
- check demo ship moving?
- center digit of awarded vulture score sometimes bogus, seems to
  be able to corrupt main score for a while too (DAA issue)
- boss killed: score not centered on screen can be bogus (DAA missing?)
- when restarting, status bar is erased at first
- hit by missiles with shield: illegal?? reproduce??
- debug copy_bank (2player) atm 2P disabled
- 60Hz

colors:

- title: reinstate the light pink for the (c) sign instead: "F4CDCF":"FFFFFF" when 4008=$79
  of white
- create a 16+16 AGA DPF version

original game bugs:

- updating highscore is to be done in real-time not when restarting a game
- applied Don Hodges fix to avoid score corruption when shooting 3 flying birds
