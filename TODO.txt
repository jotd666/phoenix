logic:

- handle_player_shot_0930: value of a0/a1 on entering?
- vultures lowering all the time, should go up from time to time: check handle_vultures_y_2600
  when going up, often locked by random +0 values!!
- boss: can't shoot the shield (birds ok, purple strip ok)
- hit by missiles with shield: illegal?? reproduce??
- debug copy_bank (2player)

colors:

- title: reinstate the light pink for the (c) sign instead: "F4CDCF":"FFFFFF" when 4008=$79
  of white
- create a 16+16 AGA DPF version

original game bugs:

- updating highscore is to be done in real-time not when restarting a game
- applied Don Hodges fix to avoid score corruption when shooting 3 flying birds
