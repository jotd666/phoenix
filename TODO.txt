logic:

- 2P mode switch: videoram seems not updated! check address of say
  lives and check value (42C2=7F)
- explosion: ship parts seem not right
- On the attract sequence, with the final boss and 1 alien flying around,
  when alien is destroyed the explosion does not disappear and is left as part of the background, so to speak. 

colors:

- palette is completely off after one round of demo (title)
  original game displays demo title with alternate palette
